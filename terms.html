                <strong>Refund Policy</strong>
            </div>

            <h3>Our Refund Policy</h3> <p>Last updated October 1, 2017</p><p>Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your payment to My Student Quarters Inc., unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or credit.</p><p>My Student Quarters Inc. solely receives payments in exchange for the services it provides.  My Student Quarters Inc. does NOT received payment for rent.</p><p>Refunds are only available for initial payments.  Initial payments, hence forth, will refer to the first payment made directly by a student to My Student Quarters Inc.  This amount varies, and is calculated based on the value of the monthly rental price set by a landlord.  For the initial payment, My Student Quarters Inc. currently collects 16.67% × 3r, where r = rent, unless otherwise specified in the deal by the landlord’s terms. My Student Quarters Inc. is not responsible for the returning of funds made of any rent payment at any time, as, at no point does My Student Quarters Inc. receive payment for rent.</p><p>To be eligible for a refund, your initial payment to My Student Quarters Inc. must have been made, while your payment of first month’s rent, last month’s rent and security deposit (equal to 1 month of rent) to your landlord is unpaid.  This would indicate it would have not been possible for My Student Quarters to render services to a student while they were not paying rent for a rental property.  My Student Quarters Inc. is obligated to return a student’s initial payment if the student fails to receive any service from My Student Quarters Inc. for the reason that at least 30 days have passed between the time a student pays My Student Quarters Inc. and the time a student takes to fulfill their payment to the landlord that is equal to 3 months of rent payments.</p><p>Subscription payments are non-refundable and are collected for the continued services rendered by My Student Quarters Inc.  These payments help My Student Quarters Inc. pay for costs associated with technical maintenance of a student’s account during the term of their lease, including partner services.</p><p>Any rent payment a student would like a refund for needs to be brought forth to the attention of their landlord whom they directly pay monthly.  My Student Quarters Inc. does not collect payment for these reasons and cannot be responsible for this exchange.</p><p>If you feel you are eligible for a refund for your initial payment to My Student Quarters Inc., please email us at info@mystudentquarters.com and provide as much information as possible about your account to assist us in understanding your claim. Once we receive your detailed email, My Student Quarters Inc. will reach back out via email and work with you to resolve the matter in the best way we can.</p><p>If you are approved, then you will be notified via email, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 30 days.</p><strong>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</strong><p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.</p><p>Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p><p>Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p><p>If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at:</p><p> <a href="mailto:info@mystudentquarters.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit">info@mystudentquarters.com</a></p>
