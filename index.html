                      <p> My Student Quarters is your one-stop shop (well, website) for everything related to off-campus student housing. Our site guides you from finding your next apartment to picking up your security deposit after your lease ends. </p> <p> We work with landlords and realtors to post local units with professional pictures, lease information, and even a map that shows you the unit's distance to your university. </p> <p> With 50+ housing filters, you are able to search efficiently for housing that meets your living style, including variable lease lengths. Once you found your spot, our verified platform connects you with the landlord, safely transfers your security deposit and signed lease, and creates a housing profile for storage of all files and information related to your current unit. </p> <p> This housing profile will be where you can set up automatic monthly rent payments, search for roommates, or contact us with questions related to your housing. My Student Quarters knows what it's like to be a student, because we are students too.</p> <p> There are a lot of exciting, stressful challenges associated with being a student, but finding and maintaining your housing no longer has to be one of them. </p>

Right now, we are focusing on the heart of our product: to make finding housing as a student easy and efficient from the comfort of your computer. As we all know, there is much more that goes into student housing than just finding your apartment and paying for it. </p> <p> MSQ wants to be involved in those details too. We have a number of (self-proclaimed) smart, creative ideas that will be added to the site as our platform continues to grow. </p><p> Get ready to make everything related to your student housing easy and fun!</p>

As the search-engine for student housing, we do all the dirty work to find and post units near your university, you only have to rent off the site with a few simple clicks! </p> <p> All members, landlords and students alike, are verified by our platform before being able to access the website. All money transfers are safely processed online and security deposits are returned to the student by us after we are given the "OK" by both parties (student and landlord). </p> <p> Students and landlords can also be reviewed by one another after a lease ends so future partnerships can make more educated decisions before signing a lease agreement. </p>

        <p> Jessica, a life-long student, first came up with the idea for "My Student Quarters" after listening to the housing struggles her colleagues faced at her university. Some students slept in cars for weeks until their apartments were available. Others could not find flexible lease lengths and had to take out extra loans to pay for months they knew they would not be staying at their apartment. A handful were even limited to outrageously high priced properties due to specific housing accommodations. And one student (guess who) just really really hated unproductive, unorganized hours wasted online searching for housing near her university. Hence, My Student Quarters (MSQ) was born. </p></div>

     <div> <h3> Sohrab Jamshidi <br> Co-Founder & Chief Strategist </h3>
        <p> Sohrab is a cofounder at My Student Quarters Inc., responsible for strategy, partnerships, finance, operations and growth.  Sohrab is a graduate of Haub’s School of Business at Saint Joseph’s University. Previously, he partially owned and operated a café on the Main Line (PA) which he sold for a small profit 2 years later after optimizing operations.  More recently, Sohrab joined forces at his father’s 2 automotive-related businesses in Philadelphia where, in 1 year, he grew the customer base from 1500 customers per year to over 2500 unique visitors.  One of Sohrab’s side projects had been an ecommerce website, kanyewestforpresident.com, back when there was buzz and a fringe fan base for such an event.  Subsequently, he saw into the future of the outsider-turned-politician trend early enough to purchase the domains markzuckerbergforpresident.com and markcubanforpresident.com.  Sohrab can also impressively juggle three round, equally-weighted objects for up to 3 consecutive minutes, which he does not like to brag about. </p></div>

                                        <p>Sohrab is a cofounder at My Student Quarters Inc., responsible for strategy, partnerships, finance, operations and growth.  Sohrab is a graduate of Haub’s School of Business at Saint Joseph’s University. Previously, he partially owned and operated a café on the Main Line (PA) which he sold for a small profit 2 years later after optimizing operations.  More recently, Sohrab joined forces at his father’s 2 automotive-related businesses in Philadelphia where, in 1 year, he grew the customer base from 1500 customers per year to over 2500 unique visitors.  One of Sohrab’s side projects had been an ecommerce website, kanyewestforpresident.com, back when there was buzz and a fringe fan base for such an event.  Subsequently, he saw into the future of the outsider-turned-politician trend early enough to purchase the domains markzuckerbergforpresident.com and markcubanforpresident.com.  Sohrab can also impressively juggle three round, equally-weighted objects for up to 3 consecutive minutes, which he does not like to brag about.</p>
